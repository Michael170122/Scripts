How to use the app:

Thirst thing to know:
-the "venv" folder contains a virtual environment,
where flask (the python library) is installed already.

Secondly:
To run the application you'll have to open the terminal and run some commands:

1. Activate the virtual env.
(In the main folder):
"source venv/bin/activate"

2."export FLASK_APP=app.py"
(do this every time you open a new terminal"

3."flask run"

Now it should give you an ip-address with a port,
which you type into your browser as a url.
Done.

Pro Tip:
Don't change the name of the rootfolder("database_app")
